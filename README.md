# Progressive Review

[Check out the site here](https://theprogressivereview.com)

This is my site where I talk about music. It's deployed with Docker and uses Strapi as a CMS. All of it is deployed on AWS continuously. 

## Getting up and running in dev

Clone the project, then create a folder called `docker-secrets` at the root of the project (probably called `progressive-review`). In here, place three files:

```
postgres_db.txt
postgres_password.txt
postgres_user.txt
```

These should contain the database name, password, and user you want the development Postgres database to have.

Then, `cd frontend` and rename the `.env.example` to `.env`. Don't bother changing the `HOST` or `PORT` values (unless you know you need to). Set the `APP_KEYS`, `API_TOKEN_SALT`, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET`, and `JWT_SECRET` for the Strapi instance. These can be securely generated by running this command for each entry: `openssl rand -base64 32`.

Next, copy over the Postgres info from the text files, and your backend environment should be all set.

Finally, run the following commands from the project root to install dependencies and start the development server.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ../backend
npm install
cd ../
./start-dev.sh
```

That should be all you need.

In the future I'll add detail about production deployment, since Strapi is kind of finnicky and this repo might help people working with Docker. If you have questions, feel free to open an issue.
